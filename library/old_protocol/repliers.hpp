/*
 * Here are grouped the implementations of n2_repliers that are called from message handler as a result of message
 * processing. For each message type, calls of n2_repliers::on_reply* callbacks are dependent on each other. For
 * example, for simple scalar requests (e.g. lookup by key) only one of callbacks (on_reply or on_reply_error) must to
 * be called, and if any extra (unexpected) call occur, would be better to resolve this situation some way to not to
 * produce the harm. At least, any unexpected on_reply* call mustn't be passed to any underlying systems, and definitely
 * mustn't to be sent by net. For more complex logic of replying, the callbacks dependence is also more complex. To
 * serve this, n2_repliers are implemented via the instance of class that looks after the order of callback calls.
